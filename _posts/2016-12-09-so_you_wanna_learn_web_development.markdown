There is a time in everyone's childhood when they flirt with a marketable skill for giggles without even realizing it. Ever since my early teens, I was always the go-to in my family for issues and questions about technology. I was the IT Consultant for the Matos Household. For my first job, I would say I was wildly successful. I received positive reviews and referrals, and even though the pay was below market value, the benefits were unbeatable. Free food, rent including utilities, and a cell phone, as well as seasonal bonus incentives (AKA birthday and Christmas presents). My boss was strict, but that's how most hispanic mothers are.

I grew up with the lingering thought that knowing how to use and troubleshoot technology was not a good enough reason to pursue it as a career. I wanted to do animation or graphic design. Most of my family members told me I would "do computers" for a living, but I didn't think I could get paid for helping them the way I did. It wasn't until I took an entry level job at an auto insurance company and got some experience with their IT department that I realized I really felt at home in this industry. I taught myself everything I needed to know to be an asset to my team, and always asked for feedback so that I knew where to improve. Ever since then, I have discovered a new, different kind of love for technology that continues to grow as I learn more.

I have done general desktop support in an office setting, retail tech support at the Apple Store, and now I am doing pre and post sales software support at a printer dealership. I have had the opportunity to work closely with a few of the biggest brands in the world. I have been able to interact with tons of great people who utilize these technologies to organize their lives and run their businesses. I want to be able to create and develop platforms for people to reach the world and share their ideas, products, and lives. I am excited to dive deep into all that Flatiron School has to offer and find my place in what I now know is the right career path.
