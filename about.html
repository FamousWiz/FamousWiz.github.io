<p>There is a time in everyone's childhood where they unknowingly toy with a marketable skill for giggles. Since my early teens, I've been the go to in my house and in my family when it comes to connecting, configuring and troubleshooting technology. I was the Chief Information Officer of the Matos Family, and I was generously compensated in food, video games, and free room and board. Fast forward about a decade, I am now trying to make a living doing what I did for fun as a teenager. I hope the days of editing myspace profile page layouts have prepared me for this.</p>
